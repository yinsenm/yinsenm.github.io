title: Load a random picture in Jekyll using Script
---
It is frustrating for the user to see the same content with different visits. Suppose we want to direct the user to a `404` page if certain link is broken. It might be comforting, if we can show him or her different `404` pages such as this [example](/404). We can load `404` pages with random pictures on it by using a little bit of `Javascript`.

Following those the two steps, We can accomplish this task.

### Step 1: A uniform figures names
First, we should named the figures file uniformly such that we can use a string expression to capture the pattern of all files. The extensions can be different such as `.jpg`, `.png`, `.icon` but the files names should be a uniform pattern like the following one:

{% highlight bash %}
figures/
        404/
            fig (1).png
            fig (2).png
            ...
            fig (8).png
{% endhighlight %} 

### Step 2: A little Javascript code
Then we add a litte Javascript code to the `404.html` page which is in the root directory generated by [Jeklly](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/). You might find useful using the [lanyon temple](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) directly.

Then add a `Javascript` line somewhere above the description such as [this](https://github.com/yinsenm/yinsenm.github.io/blob/master/404.html).

{% highlight html %}
<script>
    document.write("<img src = \"/figure/404/fig (" + Math.floor(1 + Math.random()*8) + ").png\"/>");
</script>
{% endhighlight %}
