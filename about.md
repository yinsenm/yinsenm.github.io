![my undergraduate millitary training in China.][1]
</div>

I am 2nd year graduate student from [Department of Statistics](http://statistics.rice.edu/) at Rice University. I have been fascinated by the recently development of statistical approach to data analysis and intelligence decision making. I write this [Blog](http://yinsenm.github.io/) using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here) to share some cool stuffs about machine learning, statistical computing and their applications with you.

Before [Rice](http://www.rice.edu/), I had my undergraduate time in Applied Mathematics from the School of Science at [Minzu University of China](http://www.muc.edu.cn/). Four years of study in Mathematics gave me chance to acquire some essential theoretical skills.

If you feel interested in my background and like my Blog, please add up my [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/yinsenm/). We can also get in touch timely by [E-mail](yinsenm@gmail.com).
